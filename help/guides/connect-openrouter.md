The AI writes your captions, research brief and brand emails. It uses free models, so it costs nothing.

## Open OpenRouter's Keys page

![Step 1](/help/screenshots/connect-openrouter-1.png)
<!-- mock: openrouter-keys -->

Open **openrouter.ai**, sign in (a free account is enough), then open **Keys**.

## Create a key

<!-- mock: openrouter-create -->

Tap **Create Key**, name it Sheila Studio, leave the credit limit empty and tap **Create**.

## Copy the key

![Step 3](/help/screenshots/connect-openrouter-3.png)
<!-- mock: openrouter-copy -->

Copy the key. It starts with sk-or- and is shown only once.

## Paste it and tap Check key

<!-- route: /settings/connections -->
<!-- api: POST /api/connections/openrouter/disconnect -->
<!-- target: role=textbox[name="AI · OpenRouter key"] -->

In the dashboard open **Settings**, then **Connect accounts**. Find **OpenRouter**, paste the key and tap **Check key**.

## It turns green

<!-- target: .card:has(h3:text-is("OpenRouter")) -->

The card turns green. Free models are used, so it costs nothing.
