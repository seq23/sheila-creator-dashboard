// A realistic YEAR of demo data: day 358 of Sheila using the dashboard (owner, 26 Sep 2026:
// "think about day 358 of using this"). Demo data only, never her real content, never production:
// every row id starts with `yr_` (versions 9101+ for briefs, the profile and kit versions), the
// CLI writes only to the LOCAL D1 (`--local`) or, with `--remote-sample`, ONLY to the public
// sample (wrangler.jsonc env.staging, which must be Worker `samplestudio` on a `-staging` D1 with
// FAKE_SERVICES "1"; anything else is refused), and nothing in worker/ or app/ imports it
// (validator `seed-year-local-only`). Deterministic: the same `now` gives the same rows, so the
// e2e suite, the unit tests and the day-358 screenshots all see the same year.
//
//   ~50 dumps (failed, held as someone else's, an abandoned upload, full videos for YouTube),
//   ~600 clips across every status and Look, ~300 posts (posted / failed / taken off), voice overs
//   (automatic and her own), 45 deals in every stage incl. declined and lost, 12 research briefs,
//   26 media kit versions, a year of health events and emails, and a storage bucket near 10 GB.
//
// Use:
//   node scripts/seed-year.mjs --apply          seed the local D1 the e2e Worker uses
//   node scripts/seed-year.mjs --clear          remove it again
//   node scripts/seed-year.mjs --out file.sql   write the SQL (for a look)
//   --before  leaves out the columns migration 0016 added (the "before" screenshots)
//   node scripts/seed-year.mjs --remote-sample --apply
//             reset the PUBLIC SAMPLE's D1 (staging = samplestudio) to the year: wipes every row
//             the sample holds (its connections, lights, posts, sessions), loads the year with
//             smaller file sizes (storage sits green) and the sample's own lights, then uploads
//             the demo media (scripts/sample-media.mjs) under the keys the rows point at.
//             `--remote-sample --media-only` uploads just the media, `--no-media` skips it (the
//             rows only); `--remote-sample --clear` removes the year from the sample.
