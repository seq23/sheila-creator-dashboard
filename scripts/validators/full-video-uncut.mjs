// A full video for YouTube (the third door on Dump) goes up WHOLE: it never goes through the cutter
// and is never reframed to 9:16 (owner, 26 Sep 2026). Every link of that promise is checked:
//   - the Dump button sends a full-video dump to its own job before anything that cuts;
//   - the cutter and the connected-editor path both refuse a full-video dump;
//   - the job (jobs/fullvideo.py) never imports the cutter or the Looks, never crops, never sizes
//     to a vertical frame, copies the streams (`-c copy`), and its re-encode fallback has no filter;
//   - the job may write only its own full/<dump>/ folder, never the clip folders;
//   - Review refuses the cut-only actions (Change look, music, Try another version, replace, voice over);
//   - tests prove it (tests/unit/full-video.test.ts, jobs/tests/test_fullvideo.py).
// Zero checks is a failure (Rule 0).
