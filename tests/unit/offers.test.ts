We're launching our holiday stoneware and would love to partner. We'd like 2 TikTok videos and 1 Instagram Reel.

Usage: 30 days organic on our channels. Payment net-30 on invoice.
Best, Maya (Golden Hour Tableware)`;

This is great exposure for your brand. We'll need usage rights in perpetuity across all media, and exclusivity with no other home brands for 6 months.
We also need rights to your name and likeness. Payment is net-90 after posting.`;
