// "Write the email" (docs/reviews/agency-pov.md): every email a talent manager sends for a deal,

// the AI is off or answers badly), three subject lines, the "before you send" checks it needs,
// and the instruction the AI draft follows. The AI's answer is refused if it drops her kit link
// or states a dollar figure that is not in the facts (a draft never invents money).
//
// Every key in SCENARIOS has a template here and a test in tests/unit/emails.test.ts; the
// validator `mediakit-deals` fails the build if either is missing.
